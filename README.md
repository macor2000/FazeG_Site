With the release of Call of Duty Black Ops 6 coming up, my brother and his friends have wanted to create a group for people to join. The groups mascot (and uhhhh leader) is a frog. I heard them talking 
about making a website and thought this would be a good opportunity to get some experience with making a website. I decided to use Django because it is brand new to me and is a solid framework to accelerate my 
progress on this project.
